# AAG Wind Instrument
I acquired a brand new AAG Wind Instrument that had virtually no documentation.   Most of the links on the web were broken, so I had little to go on.
The schematic that I found is almost exactly the same as my device and was enough information to get started.

I also found Arduino libraries for the three DS devices on the PCB.

## DS2450_Direction
Original code: https://github.com/jbechter/arduino-onewire-DS2450


This example demonstrates the use of the DS2450 library and the Arduino
OneWire library to read wind vane direction from a Dallas Semiconductor DS2450
quad a/d in an AAG wind vane.
