## DS2450 Direction Original code: https://github.com/jbechter/arduino-onewire-DS2450
This example demonstrates the use of the DS2450 library and the Arduino OneWire library to read wind vane direction from a Dallas Semiconductor DS2450 quad a/d in an AAG wind vane.

## DS2423WindSpeed
This is my WIP of determining the windspeed from the anenometer.
